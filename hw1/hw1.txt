Please keep all files related to a homework or an assignment within the appropriate directory. Files checked in outside of specific homework or assignment directory will not be reviewed or graded for that homework/assignment.

Check in and modify files as many times as you like. You will not be able to modify the files after the deadline.

You will work as a pair, both of you are responsible for the completed work in all assignments and homework. Reasonable effort is expected from each person.

The deadlines are strict, there will be no extensions. Don't email any code to Venkat or to the mailing list. Your last check in before the deadline will be graded. If your last check in breaks the code, both you and your pair will lose significant points.

Please feel free to ask for frequent reviews. See the reviews/readme.txt file for details on how to ask for reviews.

You can evolve the answers and solutions based on the reviews. Only the latest checkin at the time of review will be looked at. Also the final check in will be the only one graded.

Please read the academic honesty policy posted on the course mailing list.

Now to homework #1.

HW1: Due 11:59PM February 5

Q1. What's simple design?

A design that is easy to understand, easy to maintain, minimalistic (does not have irrelevant stuff), and in case it fails, that it fails gracefully.

Q2. Why should design be simple?

What a simple design is, may be subjective. However in consideration of why design should be simple is the following. Design should evaluate simplicity, because simple design is maintainable rather than a complex design. 
This ideology would prevent high cost of fix, which holds economic value. Maintainable simple design allows modulatory which can value the design at a higher quality. 

Q3. In your experience, from what you've seen, has there been problems with design not being simple or benefits from it being simple? Give examples of situations and impact. Discuss.

No there has never been an issue with a simpler code. Usually the code at first attempt comes out to be a large clutter. Found erasing the entire code and starting from scratch to be an inventive process as compared to initial attempt.
Recently I had to write a code for signal processing which I chose to write in python. First attempt design vs. last design the following can be observed. First attempt hold far more variables and unnecessary use of complex algorithm, and interestingly less utilization of functional programming. The last design much short in length, variables, and inclusion of functional programming paradigm. Also to point out simple design does not necessarily mean less the task than complex. My last design hold automated task which were needed to be performed after script ended which the first attempt larger in size did not.
