According to the article <http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html>, what are the rules of simple design. Why are these important? Discuss the impact of these principles. Give examples of using these principles in the class so far. Also, if you like, give from examples outside of this class, but limit to your personal experiences.

REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR ANSWER

Martin Fowler discusses the four rules of simple design by Kent Beck from Extreme Programming.
In the priority of most significant to taking precedence over next are the following
Passes the tests, Reveals intention, No duplication, and fewest elements.
Passes the tests is most important because it's primary aim is to claim the software works as intended.
Reveals intention is essentially self-documenting code, which eases readability of code and enables understanding of the programmer's intent.
No duplication also known as the DRY principle. DRY defines don't repeat yourself. According to the article, elimination of duplicated code "is a powerful way to drive out good designs."
