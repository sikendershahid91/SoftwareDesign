Assign1: Due 11:59PM February 26

Using Test First Development (no code without test first) implement the problem you designed in hw2. Feel free to evolve that design and use your judgment to make changes based on the improved understanding and learning.

Take small steps, ask for frequent reviews.

First start with a tests list and a canary test.

After completing the assignment (and only after) answer the following questions:

1. What did you learn mainly in this assignment?

We learnt mainly to do TDD. Simplify your code, don't add unneccessary addition, and always use automatic test for your code.

2. How is your current design different, if at all, from the strategic design created in hw2?

We created only a main class for the engine. And 2-3 smaller helper enum classes to communicate the game progress. ColorPool and ColorSelection classes we decided on did not end up in the code. Our GameUI is sketchy. It only contains one class that do both controller and model responsibilites.

3. Were there any surprise or things you did not expect along the way? Any 
particular problem faced, things you had to tackle that you did not expect 
beforehand?

We did not expect to write that many tests for the code. We had planned a certain schedule. That schedule did not work out as planned. We should devote time better to tactical scheduling.
