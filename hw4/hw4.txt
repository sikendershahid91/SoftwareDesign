1. What did you essentially learn in this course about design?

I learnt about the importance of software design, and the best way to approach it. In the process of creating software, the task of building (compiling) is actually the cheapest. A lot of effort and money is spent on designing software. Therefore, the best software is usually highly reusuable.

When given a task, a software engineer usually needs time to totally figure out. Too much upfront design is a terrible decision because you don't know really understand the problem yet. Test-driven development methodology is a great way to start writing software. You create tests to document the expectations of what your code does. This way, programmers are driven to think about the tactical design. Good code comes from being continuously rewritten, refactored. You start with some small code, and continuously expand it, and then refactor it again when you see fit.

In general, the SOLID (single responbility, open closed, Liskov substitution, and dependecy inversion) principles of object-oriented programming should be followed closely. These principles allow you to feel the bad smells of the code, and guide you to fix it.

Programming patterns are some good ways to create code, and communicate the coding ideas you have. However, you should not blindly use patterns. When learning a new pattern, you work on a few examples to get a feel of how it works. When you deal with a problem, you will be able to think of several possible patterns and how to modify them.

2. What are some of the general guidelines you would follow when designing?

When start writing code for a program, you start with a canary to make sure the environments are set up.
