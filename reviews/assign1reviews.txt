synopsis: let's focus on the most important things first 

details:
*** Start with a canary test. If you don't know what a canary test is,
see the TDD videos.

Delete everything and start over. We will start with a focus on the most important things first.

Write a test where all colors match.
call a function setSelection and send five different colors.
Then call a function guess and send the same colors.
Check that the response from the guess function has five black colors.
Write minimum code to make this test pass.

Now, write a test where all colors don't match.
Keep the same colors as in the previous test.
Send to guess five different colors that are not in the selected colors.
verify the response is all white colors.

Change the name of the test class to CodeBreakerTest. Change the name of the
class to CodeBreaker.

After you have minimum code to pass the two tests plus the canary test, ask for review.

I've created a build file to run the tests from the command prompt.
Type paver to run the tests and make sure all tests are passing before
checking in any code change.
