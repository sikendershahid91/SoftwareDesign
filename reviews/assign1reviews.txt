synopsis: fix and move forward. 

details:
Wow, comments in code. Remove all comments. Instead write readable code.

test_set_selection_with_less_than_5_colors: Remove

test_set_selection_with_more_than_5_colors: Remove

test_set_selection_with_variable_wrong_type: Remove

test_guess_with_less_than_5_colors: Keep

"guess accepts less than 5 colors" should this read "guess does not accepts less than 5 colors"?

test_guess_with_more_than_5_colors: Keep

### irrelevent  - Remove comments in code.

test_guess_with_variable_wrong_type: Remove

test_guess_while_selection_not_set: Remove

test_game_all_match_for_correct_guess:
The \ at the end of lines are noisy. Let's remove them.

The function setSelection is a helper function, no need to write tests for these. The purpose of this function is to get us to verify the behavior of the guess function.

After fixing the above, move on to test various scenarios of guess, with different combinations. After that move on to write tests for the color selection function (not setSelection). Then test for the number of tries a player is allowed.

synopsis: let's program with intention. 

details:
ColorSelection: Remove

TestCases: Remove this test class.

CodeSelectionTest: Remove this test class.

At this time of the design we only need one test class and one class, nothing more.

CodeBreakerTest:
tearDown: Remove

test_new_game_has_20_chances: Remove


test_game_return_5_blacks_for_correct_guess:
Instead of string, can we use enum for colors.
Instead of string 'Black' can we program with intention and use a values like MATCH_POSITION, NOMATCH, MATCH, for example?

Write positive and negative tests for guess. Think of situations like:
1. all colors in guess match by position with selected colors
2. no colors in guess are present in the selected colors
3. all colors in guess are in selected colors, but none in correct position
4. some colors in the guess match by position, some match but not in position, some are not in the selected colors
5. guess uses a color twice when the selection has no repeated colors
6. guess uses a color twice where one of them matches the selection by position and the other matches but not in position
7. guess uses a color twice and they match selection in place
8. guess has few colors than five

synopsis: let's focus on the most important things first 

details:
*** Start with a canary test. If you don't know what a canary test is,
see the TDD videos.

Delete everything and start over. We will start with a focus on the most important things first.

Write a test where all colors match.
call a function setSelection and send five different colors.
Then call a function guess and send the same colors.
Check that the response from the guess function has five black colors.
Write minimum code to make this test pass.

Now, write a test where all colors don't match.
Keep the same colors as in the previous test.
Send to guess five different colors that are not in the selected colors.
verify the response is all white colors.

Change the name of the test class to CodeBreakerTest. Change the name of the
class to CodeBreaker.

After you have minimum code to pass the two tests plus the canary test, ask for review.

I've created a build file to run the tests from the command prompt.
Type paver to run the tests and make sure all tests are passing before
checking in any code change.
